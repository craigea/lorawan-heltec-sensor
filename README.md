TL;DR

This repository supports a production IoT sensor providing 

	- instantaneous power measurements using a CT Clamp
	- temperature 
	- humidity
	
The device, Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V2, is communicating via LoraWAN on the Helium Network (HNT) in the SF Bay Area, USA.  The sensor was also working on HNT and The Things Networks in Munich, Germany.  The impetus for this project was to confirm that several pumps were working at a site 9 time zones away with no access to WLAN and unreliable personnel.  Energy usage was not the goal, but the project could be expanded to include this in the future.
